Please read `README.gnu-build-system` to get\r\nfurther details about how to bootstrap `libsemver` from sources on your machine.\r\n\r\nGetting a copy of the source repository is not recommended unless you are a\r\ndeveloper, you have the GNU Build System installed on your machine, and you know\r\nhow to bootstrap it on the sources.\r\n\r\n[release]: https://github.com/emcrisostomo/semver-utils/releases\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSee the `INSTALL` file for detailed information about how to configure and\r\ninstall this package.  Since `semver` builds and uses dynamic libraries, in some\r\nplatforms you may need to perform additional tasks before you can use it:\r\n\r\n  * Make sure the installation directory of dynamic libraries (`$PREFIX/lib`) is\r\n    included in the lookup paths of the dynamic linker of your operating system.\r\n    The default path, `/usr/local/lib`, will work in nearly every operating\r\n    system.\r\n\r\n  * Refreshing the links and cache to the dynamic libraries may be required.  In\r\n    GNU/Linux systems you may need to run `ldconfig`:\r\n\r\n        $ ldconfig\r\n\r\n`libsemver` is a C++ program and a C++ compiler compliant with the C++11 standard\r\nis required to compile it.  Check your OS documentation for information about\r\nhow to install the C++ toolchain and the C++ runtime.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n`libsemver` provides the following documentation:\r\n\r\n  * HTML documentation.\r\n  * PDF documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocalization\r\n------------\r\n\r\n`libsemver` is localizable and internally it uses GNU `gettext` to decouple\r\nlocalizable string from their translation.  The currently available locales are:\r\n\r\n  * English (`en`).\r\n  * Italian (`it`).\r\n  * Spanish (`es`).\r\n\r\nTo build `libsemver` with localization support, you need to have `gettext`\r\ninstalled on your system.  If `configure` cannot find `<libintl.h>` or the\r\nlinker cannot find `libintl`, then you may need to manually provide their\r\nlocation to `configure`, usually using the `CPPFLAGS` and the `LDFLAGS`\r\nvariables.  See `README.osx` for an example.\r\n\r\nIf `gettext` is not available on your system, `libsemver` shall build correctly,\r\nbut it will lack localization support and the only available locale will be\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n`semver` accepts a list of versions as parameters and the operation performed on\r\nthem depends on the command being executed.\r\n\r\n    $ semver command [options] ... version-0 ... version-n\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of accepted arguments depends on the `command` being\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\n`command` may be one of the following:\r\n\r\n  * `-b`: versions are _bumped_.\r\n\r\n  * `-c`: versions are _compared_.\r\n\r\n  * `-s`: versions are _sorted_.\r\n\r\n  * `-v`: versions are _verified_.\r\n\r\nFor more information, refer to the `semver` documentation or the output of the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n    $ semver --help\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nEverybody is welcome to contribute to `libsemver`.  Please, see\r\n[`CONTRIBUTING`][contrib] for further information.\r\n\r\n[contrib]: CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\nBug Reports\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nBug reports can be reported as issues on the [project home page][semver-utils].\r\n\r\n[semver-utils]: https://github.com/emcrisostomo/semver-utils\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Enrico M.
